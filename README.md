* This repo contains C++ and verilog implementation of LDPC decoder using BF algorithem.
* This repository is used to learn LDPC decoder and is mainly guided by reference 1 and 2.
* But the C++ implementation and HDL implementation is refactored. 
* The simulation result is shown in `/simulate_rst` folder.
